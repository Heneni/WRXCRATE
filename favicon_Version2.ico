This is a blank favicon.ico file.

To fix the 404 error, create a new file in your repository named "favicon.ico" at the root level.
It can be empty or you can use any online favicon generator to create a valid favicon.ico.

This will eliminate the "Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (favicon.ico)" error.
